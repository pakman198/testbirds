Code Challenge for [Testbirds](https://www.testbirds.com/).

The challenge consists on a component that displays a group of members
for a team.

The user can add or remove members to that team.

It uses local storage to display previously saved members and limits the display to 5
members; the user is able to see all the members of a given team by clicking on SHOW ALL
button.
